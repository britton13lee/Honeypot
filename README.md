# Honeypot
Honeypots deployed:
I was unable to connect to the admin VM via the honeypot VM.

Issues encountered:
I spent 5 hours trying to access the admin VM via the external IP, including with the help of TAs and Codepath Support before finally getting it to work. The github repo on the assignments page didn't work. There weren't enough clear instructions on how to make the VM http accessible. The MHN Troubleshooting Guide could not resolve the problems I had.

Summary of data collected:
I was unable to collect any data.

Unresolved questions:
How to get this to work.
