# Honeypot
Honeypots deployed:
Dionaea with HTTP, Snort, Shockpot

Issues encountered:
I spent 5 hours trying to access the admin VM via the external IP, including with the help of TAs and Codepath Support before finally getting it to work. The github repo on the assignments page didn't work. There weren't enough clear instructions on how to make the VM http accessible. The MHN Troubleshooting Guide could not resolve the problems I had.

Summary of data collected:


Unresolved questions:
None.
