# Honeypot
Honeypots deployed:
Dionaea with HTTP, Snort, Shockpot, Wordpot

Issues encountered:
I spent 5 hours trying to access the admin VM via the external IP, including with the help of TAs and Codepath Support before finally getting it to work. The github repo on the assignments page didn't work. There weren't enough clear instructions on how to make the VM http accessible. The MHN Troubleshooting Guide could not resolve the problems I had. I spent another 3 hours trying to figure out why the wget command wasn't working, and it's because the deploy page gives the wrong IP. This assignment had way too many bugs in the instructions.

Summary of data collected:


Unresolved questions:
